defmodule AshGrant.FieldGroupIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  End-to-end integration tests for field group access control.

  Tests the full flow: create records with authorize?: false, then read
  with different field_group permissions and verify which fields are
  visible vs replaced with %Ash.ForbiddenField{}.

  Uses the SensitiveRecord ETS resource which has:
  - field_group :public       — [:name, :department, :position]
  - field_group :sensitive    — inherits :public, adds [:phone, :address]
  - field_group :confidential — inherits :sensitive, adds [:salary, :email]
  - default_policies true, default_field_policies true
  - scope :all, true
