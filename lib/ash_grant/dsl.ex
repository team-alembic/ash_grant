defmodule AshGrant.Dsl do
  @moduledoc """
  DSL definition for AshGrant extension.

  This module defines the `ash_grant` DSL section that can be added to
  Ash resources to configure permission-based authorization.

  ## DSL Options

  | Option | Type | Required | Description |
  |--------|------|----------|-------------|
  | `resolver` | module or function | **Yes** | Resolves permissions for actors |
  | `resource_name` | string | No | Resource name for permission matching |
  | `default_policies` | boolean or atom | No | Auto-generate policies (`true`, `:all`, `:read`, `:write`) |
  | `owner_field` | atom | No | **Deprecated.** Use `scope :own, expr(...)` instead |

  ## Scope Entity

  The `scope` entity defines named scopes that translate to Ash filter expressions.
  This replaces the need for a separate `ScopeResolver` module.

  | Argument | Type | Description |
  |----------|------|-------------|
  | `name` | atom | The scope name (e.g., `:all`, `:own`, `:published`) |
  | `filter` | expression or boolean | The filter expression or `true` for no filter |

  | Option | Type | Description |
  |--------|------|-------------|
  | `inherits` | list of atoms | Parent scopes to inherit and combine with |

  ## Example

      defmodule MyApp.Blog.Post do
        use Ash.Resource,
          extensions: [AshGrant]

        ash_grant do
          resolver MyApp.PermissionResolver
          resource_name "post"

          scope :all, true
          scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))
          scope :published, expr(status == :published)
          scope :own_draft, [:own], expr(status == :draft)
        end
      end

  ## Resolver

  The `resolver` option specifies how to get permissions for an actor.
  It can be:

  - A module implementing `AshGrant.PermissionResolver` behaviour
  - A 2-arity function `(actor, context) -> [permissions]`

  ## Resource Name

  The `resource_name` option overrides the resource name used in
  permission matching. If not specified, it's derived from the module
  name (e.g., `MyApp.Blog.Post` → `"post"`).

  ## Owner Field (Deprecated)

  The `owner_field` option is **deprecated** and will be removed in v1.0.0.
  Use explicit scope expressions instead:

      # Instead of owner_field :author_id, use:
      scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))

  ## Context Injection

  Scopes can use `^context(:key)` for injectable values, enabling deterministic
  testing of temporal and parameterized scopes:

      ash_grant do
        resolver MyApp.PermissionResolver

        # Injectable temporal scope
        scope :today, expr(fragment("DATE(inserted_at) = ?", ^context(:reference_date)))

        # Injectable threshold scope
        scope :small_amount, expr(amount < ^context(:max_amount))
      end

  Inject values at query/changeset time:

      Post
      |> Ash.Query.for_read(:read)
      |> Ash.Query.set_context(%{reference_date: Date.utc_today()})
      |> Ash.read!(actor: actor)

  This is preferred over database functions like `CURRENT_DATE` for testability.
