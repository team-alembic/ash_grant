defmodule AshGrant.Dsl do
  @moduledoc """
  DSL definition for AshGrant extension.

  This module defines the `ash_grant` DSL section that can be added to
  Ash resources to configure permission-based authorization.

  ## DSL Options

  | Option | Type | Required | Description |
  |--------|------|----------|-------------|
  | `resolver` | module or function | **Yes** | Resolves permissions for actors |
  | `resource_name` | string | No | Resource name for permission matching |
  | `default_policies` | boolean or atom | No | Auto-generate policies (`true`, `:all`, `:read`, `:write`) |
  | `default_field_policies` | boolean | No | Auto-generate `field_policies` from `field_group` definitions |
  | `can_perform_actions` | list of atoms | No | Batch-generate CanPerform calculations (e.g., `[:update, :destroy]`) |
  | `owner_field` | atom | No | **Deprecated.** Use `scope :own, expr(...)` instead |

  ## Scope Entity

  The `scope` entity defines named scopes that translate to Ash filter expressions.
  This replaces the need for a separate `ScopeResolver` module.

  | Argument | Type | Description |
  |----------|------|-------------|
  | `name` | atom | The scope name (e.g., `:all`, `:own`, `:published`) |
  | `filter` | expression or boolean | The filter expression or `true` for no filter |

  | Option | Type | Description |
  |--------|------|-------------|
  | `description` | string | Human-readable description for explain/4 output |
  | `write` | expression, boolean, or nil | **Deprecated.** Prefer argument-based scopes + `resolve_argument`. See below. |

  ### Read vs write semantics

  The `filter` expression is used for read actions (converted to SQL via `FilterCheck`).
  For write actions, `Check` evaluates the scope — simple scopes use in-memory
  evaluation, while scopes with relationship references (`exists()` or dot-paths)
  automatically use a DB query to verify the scope.

  For multi-hop authorization ("refund → order → center_id"), prefer
  argument-based scopes together with `resolve_argument`:

      scope :at_own_unit, expr(^arg(:center_id) in ^actor(:own_org_unit_ids))
      resolve_argument :center_id, from_path: [:order, :center_id]

  See `guides/argument-based-scope.md` for the full rationale and examples.

  ### `write:` option (deprecated)

  The `write:` option was introduced as an escape hatch for relational scopes
  whose `filter` expression could not be evaluated in memory on write actions.
  It is deprecated as of 0.14 — prefer argument-based scopes + `resolve_argument`,
  or gate read-only semantics via separate scope names or the policy layer.

  Using `write:` still works but emits a compile-time deprecation warning.

  ## CanPerform Entity

  The `can_perform` entity generates a boolean `CanPerform` calculation for a
  single action. Use `can_perform_actions` for batch generation.

  | Argument | Type | Description |
  |----------|------|-------------|
  | `action` | atom | The action name (e.g., `:update`, `:destroy`) |

  | Option | Type | Default | Description |
  |--------|------|---------|-------------|
  | `name` | atom | `:can_<action>?` | Custom calculation name |
  | `public?` | boolean | `true` | Whether the calculation is public |

  ### Examples

      # Batch — generates :can_update? and :can_destroy?
      can_perform_actions [:update, :destroy]

      # Individual
      can_perform :update

      # Individual with custom name
      can_perform :read, name: :visible?

  ## Example

      defmodule MyApp.Blog.Post do
        use Ash.Resource,
          extensions: [AshGrant]

        ash_grant do
          resolver MyApp.PermissionResolver
          resource_name "post"

          scope :always, true
          scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))
          scope :published, expr(status == :published)
          scope :own_draft, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id) and status == :draft)

          # Relational scope — works for reads and writes automatically
          scope :team_visible, expr(exists(team.members, user_id == ^actor(:id)))

          # UI visibility calculations
          can_perform_actions [:update, :destroy]
        end
      end

  ## Resolver

  The `resolver` option specifies how to get permissions for an actor.
  It can be:

  - A module implementing `AshGrant.PermissionResolver` behaviour
  - A 2-arity function `(actor, context) -> [permissions]`

  ## Resource Name

  The `resource_name` option overrides the resource name used in
  permission matching. If not specified, it's derived from the module
  name (e.g., `MyApp.Blog.Post` → `"post"`).

  ## Owner Field (Deprecated)

  The `owner_field` option is **deprecated** and will be removed in v1.0.0.
  Use explicit scope expressions instead:

      # Instead of owner_field :author_id, use:
      scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))

  ## Context Injection

  Scopes can use `^context(:key)` for injectable values, enabling deterministic
  testing of temporal and parameterized scopes:

      ash_grant do
        resolver MyApp.PermissionResolver

        # Injectable temporal scope
        scope :today, expr(fragment("DATE(inserted_at) = ?", ^context(:reference_date)))

        # Injectable threshold scope
        scope :small_amount, expr(amount < ^context(:max_amount))
      end

  Inject values at query/changeset time:

      Post
      |> Ash.Query.for_read(:read)
      |> Ash.Query.set_context(%{reference_date: Date.utc_today()})
      |> Ash.read!(actor: actor)

  This is preferred over database functions like `CURRENT_DATE` for testability.

  @scope %Spark.Dsl.Entity{
    name: :scope,
    describe: """
    Defines a named scope with its filter expression.

    Scopes are referenced in permissions as the fourth part: `resource:*:action:scope`

    ## Examples

        # No filtering - access to all records
        scope :always, true

        # Filter to records owned by the actor
        scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))

        # Description via keyword option
        scope :published, expr(status == :published),
          description: "Published records visible to everyone"

        # Description via do-block
        scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id)) do
          description "Records owned by the current user"
        end

        # Combine conditions directly — scopes don't inherit
        scope :own_draft, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id) and status == :draft)

        # Context injection for testable temporal scopes
        scope :today, expr(fragment("DATE(inserted_at) = ?", ^context(:reference_date))),
          description: "Records created today"

        # Relational scope — DB query fallback handles writes automatically
        scope :team_member, expr(exists(team.members, user_id == ^actor(:id)))

    Each scope is standalone: if you want a combined filter, write the combined
    expression directly with `and`.

    For multi-hop authorization (e.g., "refund.order.center_id"), prefer
    argument-based scopes paired with `resolve_argument`:

        scope :at_own_unit, expr(^arg(:center_id) in ^actor(:own_org_unit_ids))
        resolve_argument :center_id, from_path: [:order, :center_id]

  - `:name` - The atom name of the field group (e.g., `:public`, `:sensitive`)

  - `:mask` - Optional list of fields to mask (return masked values instead of hiding)
  - `:mask_with` - Optional 2-arity function `(value, field_name) -> masked_value`
