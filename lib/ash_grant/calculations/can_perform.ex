defmodule AshGrant.Calculation.CanPerform do
  @moduledoc """
  Ash calculation that produces per-record boolean values for UI visibility.

  Mirrors `AshGrant.FilterCheck`'s logic to determine if the current actor
  can perform a specific action on each record. The result compiles to SQL
  via `expression/2`, running in a single query with no N+1.

  ## Usage

      calculations do
        calculate :can_update?, :boolean,
          {AshGrant.Calculation.CanPerform, action: "update", resource: __MODULE__}

        calculate :can_destroy?, :boolean,
          {AshGrant.Calculation.CanPerform, action: "destroy", resource: __MODULE__}
      end

  Then in queries:

      members = Member |> Ash.Query.load([:can_update?, :can_destroy?]) |> Ash.read!(actor: actor)

  And in templates:

      <.button :if={member.can_update?}>Edit</.button>

  ## Options

  | Option | Type | Description |
  |--------|------|-------------|
  | `:action` | string | **Required.** Action name for permission matching (e.g., "update", "destroy") |
  | `:resource` | module | **Required.** The resource module. Use `__MODULE__` in the calculations block |
  | `:resource_name` | string | Override resource name for permission matching |

  ## How It Works

  1. Resolves actor's permissions via the configured `PermissionResolver`
  2. Gets RBAC scopes via `AshGrant.Evaluator.get_all_scopes/4`
  3. Gets instance IDs via `AshGrant.Evaluator.get_matching_instance_ids/4`
  4. Builds a combined boolean expression:
     - "all"/"global" in scopes -> `true`
     - No scopes AND no instances -> `false`
     - RBAC scopes -> scope filters combined with OR
     - Instance IDs -> `id in ^instance_ids`
     - Both -> RBAC filter OR instance filter
