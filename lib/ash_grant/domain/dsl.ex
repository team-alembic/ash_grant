defmodule AshGrant.Domain.Dsl do
  @moduledoc """
  DSL definition for the AshGrant domain-level extension.

  This module defines the `ash_grant` DSL section that can be added to
  Ash domains to configure shared permission settings inherited by resources.

  Only `resolver` and `scope` entities are supported at the domain level.
  Resource-specific options like `resource_name`, `default_policies`, and
  `field_group` must be configured on each resource.

  ## Example

      defmodule MyApp.Blog do
        use Ash.Domain,
          extensions: [AshGrant.Domain]

        ash_grant do
          resolver MyApp.PermissionResolver

          scope :all, true
          scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))
        end

        resources do
          resource MyApp.Blog.Post   # inherits resolver + scopes
          resource MyApp.Blog.Comment # inherits resolver + scopes
        end
      end
