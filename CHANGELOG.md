## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **SAT Solver Optimization Callbacks**: Implements `Ash.Policy.Check` optional callbacks for smarter authorization decisions
  - `simplify/2` - Returns ref unchanged (permissions are runtime-resolved)
  - `implies?/3` - Returns `true` when check refs have identical module and options
  - `conflicts?/3` - Returns `false` (deny-wins is handled at evaluation time)
  - Enables the authorizer to reach decisions with fewer variables in conditions
  - Suggested by Jonatan Männchen (Ash contributor)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- **Permission Introspection Module**: New `AshGrant.Introspect` module for runtime permission queries
  - `actor_permissions/3` - Admin UI: Display all permissions with their status for an actor
  - `available_permissions/1` - Permission management: List all possible permission combinations
  - `can?/4` - Debugging: Simple check returning `:allow` or `:deny` with details
  - `allowed_actions/3` - API response: List allowed actions (with optional `:detailed` mode)
  - `permissions_for/3` - Raw access to permission strings from resolver
  - All functions support `:context` option for resolver context

- **Instance Permission Read Support**: Instance permissions now work with read actions (`filter_check/1`)
  - `AshGrant.Evaluator.get_matching_instance_ids/3` extracts instance IDs from permissions
  - `FilterCheck` combines RBAC scopes with instance ID filters using OR logic
  - Enables Google Docs-style sharing where specific resources are shared with specific users
  - Example: `"doc:doc_abc123:read:"` allows reading the specific document

## [0.3.1] - 2025-01-05

### Added

- **Scope Descriptions**: Optional `description` field for scopes in the DSL
  - `scope :own, [], expr(author_id == ^actor(:id)), description: "Records owned by the current user"`
  - `AshGrant.Info.scope_description/2` to retrieve scope descriptions programmatically
  - Descriptions are displayed in `explain/4` output for better debugging

- **Authorization Debugging with `explain/4`**: New `AshGrant.explain/4` function for debugging authorization decisions
  - Returns `AshGrant.Explanation` struct with detailed decision info
  - Shows matching permissions with metadata (description, source)
  - Shows all evaluated permissions with match/no-match reasons
  - Includes scope information from both permissions and DSL definitions
  - `AshGrant.Explanation.to_string/2` for human-readable output with ANSI colors

- **New Modules**:
  - `AshGrant.Explanation` - Struct for authorization decision explanations
  - `AshGrant.Explainer` - Builds detailed authorization explanations

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-04

### Added

- **Permission Metadata**: `AshGrant.PermissionInput` struct for permissions with metadata
  - `description` - Human-readable description of the permission
  - `source` - Where the permission came from (e.g., "role:admin")
  - `metadata` - Additional arbitrary metadata as a map

- **Permissionable Protocol**: `AshGrant.Permissionable` protocol for converting custom structs to permissions
  - Implement for your own structs to return them directly from resolvers
  - Default implementations for `BitString`, `PermissionInput`, and `Permission`

- **Instance Permissions with Scopes (ABAC)**: Instance permissions now support scope conditions
  - `doc:doc_123:update:draft` - Update only when document is in draft status
  - `doc:doc_123:read:business_hours` - Access only during business hours
  - `invoice:inv_456:approve:small_amount` - Approve only below threshold
  - Scopes are now treated as "authorization conditions" rather than just "record filters"
  - Empty scopes (trailing colon) remain backward compatible ("no conditions")

- **New Evaluator Functions**:
  - `get_instance_scope/3` - Get the scope from a matching instance permission
  - `get_all_instance_scopes/3` - Get all scopes from matching instance permissions

- **Context Injection for Testable Scopes**: Scopes can now use `^context(:key)` for injectable values
  - `scope :today_injectable, expr(fragment("DATE(inserted_at) = ?", ^context(:reference_date)))`
  - `scope :threshold, expr(amount < ^context(:max_amount))`
  - Enables deterministic testing of temporal and parameterized scopes
  - Values are passed via `Ash.Query.set_context(%{reference_date: ~D[2025-01-15]})`

### Changed

- **Documentation**: Clarified that scope represents an "authorization condition" that can apply
  to both RBAC and instance permissions, enabling full ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)

## [0.2.2] - 2025-01-02

### Fixed

- **Documentation**: Removed deprecated `owner_field` from README examples
- **Documentation**: Added note that instance permissions currently only work with write actions (`check/1`)

### Changed

- **Tests**: Enabled previously skipped "own" scope update tests that now pass

## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-01

### Added

- **Multi-tenancy Support**: Full support for Ash's `^tenant()` template in scope expressions
  - `scope :same_tenant, expr(tenant_id == ^tenant())` now works correctly
  - Tenant context is passed through to `Ash.Expr.eval/2`
  - Smart fallback evaluation when Ash.Expr.eval returns `:unknown`
- **TenantPost test resource**: Demonstrates multi-tenancy scope patterns

### Deprecated

- **`owner_field` DSL option**: This option is deprecated and will be removed in v0.3.0.
  Use explicit scope expressions instead:
  ```elixir
  # Instead of: owner_field :author_id
  # Use: scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))
  ```
  The fallback evaluation now extracts the field from the scope expression directly.

### Improved

- **Fallback expression evaluation**: Smarter handling when `Ash.Expr.eval` can't evaluate
  - Analyzes filter to detect `^tenant()` and `^actor()` references
  - Automatically extracts actor field from the filter expression (no `owner_field` needed)
  - Proper tenant isolation for write actions

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-01

### Added

- **Default Policies**: New `default_policies` DSL option to auto-generate standard policies
  - `default_policies true` or `:all` - Generate both read and write policies
  - `default_policies :read` - Only generate filter_check policy for read actions
  - `default_policies :write` - Only generate check policy for write actions
  - Eliminates boilerplate policy declarations for common use cases
- **Transformer**: `AshGrant.Transformers.AddDefaultPolicies` generates policies at compile time
- **Info helper**: `AshGrant.Info.default_policies/1` to query the setting

### Improved

- **Expression evaluation**: Now uses `Ash.Expr.eval/2` for proper Ash expression handling
  - Full support for all Ash expression operators (not just `==` and `in`)
  - Proper actor template resolution (`^actor(:id)`, `^actor(:tenant_id)`, etc.)
  - Proper tenant template resolution (`^tenant()`)
  - Handles nested actor paths automatically
- **Code quality**: Removed ~60 lines of custom expression handling in favor of Ash built-ins

### DSL Configuration (Updated)

```elixir
ash_grant do
  resolver MyApp.PermissionResolver       # Required
  default_policies true                   # NEW: auto-generate policies
  resource_name "custom_name"             # Optional

  scope :all, true
  scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))
  scope :published, expr(status == :published)
end
```

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-01

### Added

- **Unified Permission Format**: New 4-part permission syntax `resource:instance_id:action:scope`
  - RBAC permissions: `blog:*:read:all` (instance_id = `*`)
  - Instance permissions: `blog:post_abc123:read:` (specific instance)
  - Backward compatible with legacy 2-part and 3-part formats
- **Scope DSL**: Define scopes inline within resources using the `scope` entity
  - `scope :all, true`
  - `scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))`
  - `scope :published, expr(status == :published)`
  - Scope inheritance with `scope :own_draft, [:own], expr(status == :draft)`
- **Deny-wins semantics**: Deny rules always override allow rules
- **Wildcard matching**: `*` for resources/actions, `read*` for action prefixes
- **Two check types**:
  - `AshGrant.filter_check/1` for read actions (returns filter expression)
  - `AshGrant.check/1` for write actions (returns true/false)
- **Property-based testing**: 34 property tests for edge case discovery
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: 211 total tests (19 doctests + 34 properties + 158 unit tests)

### DSL Configuration

```elixir
ash_grant do
  resolver MyApp.PermissionResolver       # Required
  resource_name "custom_name"             # Optional

  # Inline scope definitions (new!)
  scope :all, true
  scope :own, expr(author_id == ^actor(:id))
  scope :published, expr(status == :published)
end
```

### Behaviours

- `AshGrant.PermissionResolver` - Resolves permissions for actors
- `AshGrant.ScopeResolver` - Legacy: translates scopes to Ash filters (deprecated in favor of scope DSL)
